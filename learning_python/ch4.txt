# Four Python's core data types:
# number, string, boolean, lists, tuples, files and sets
# core because they constitute the types in which every type contains at least 1 of them
# immutable are structures which can't have elements changed in place, such as tuples
# sequences is a positionaly ordered collection of objects, such as lists, strings and tuples
# mapping is a 1 to 1, or 1 to many relationship, in other words, associated values, such as dictionaries
# polymorphism means many forms, it means that an operation (like a +) depends on the objects being operated on.
